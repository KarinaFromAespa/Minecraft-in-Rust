# Minecraft in Rust — Java Edition 26.3

**Minecraft: Java Edition 26.3, rewritten in Rust.** This directory is one
version of the [Minecraft-in-Rust](../../README.md) programme: every major
Java Edition release, 1.0 → 26.3, rewritten in Rust for desktop — a reference reimplementation,
each version specified and verified against its own jar.

26.3 is the programme's **base version**: the rewrite the other versions are
ported from. Its status is tracked in [VERSIONS.md](../../VERSIONS.md), and
the programme plan is in [docs/ROADMAP.md](../../docs/ROADMAP.md).

## Base and credit

This codebase derives from the **horizon-rust** project, whose version-port
pipeline (`tools/version_port.py`, design in `docs/version-ports.md`) and
parity-harness method this programme builds on. The code is used here as a
foundation under its MIT licence. This directory is part of an independent
programme; it is not the Horizon project, and its releases, community and
website are separate. Upstream: <https://github.com/ludovic111/horizon>.

## How this version is held to account

- **Vanilla is the specification.** Behaviour is reimplemented from the
  version's own jar and checked against it with parity harnesses: a Java
  oracle and a Rust probe run identical inputs and their outputs are diffed.
- **Nothing Mojang-derived is committed.** Jars, mappings and decompiled
  sources are development-time reference only. Players prepare this
  version's data from their own copy of the game (`horizon-prepare`).
- The version pins itself with `research-lock.json` in this directory
  (version, jar hashes, Java major).

## Working in this tree

- The codebase map for agents is [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); the working method
  is [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md); design and architecture notes are
  under `docs/`.
- Build from source with the Cargo workspace in this directory
  (`Cargo.toml`); the tree's own docs describe the pipeline and the
  per-version porting flow.
